                <p class="description">
                    I have a love for animals and my favorite animal by far is the elphant.
                    I had an oppurtunity to ride one at an elephant sanctuary in Thailand. 
                    They are such majestic animals and I hope to see an African elephant one day as well.

                <p class="details">Movie | Thriller | Quentin Tarintino</p>
                <p class="description">
                    This is my all time favorite movie. I am an action film fanatic
                    and this movie has the perfect balance of thrill, action, and redemption. <em>**unsheathes sword emphatically!**</em>

                <img src="luau.jpg" alt="Hawaiian Luau" />
                <h2>A Hawaiian Luau</h2>
                <p class="details">Hawaii | Polynesian | Luau</p>
                <p class="description">
                    As a resident of Hawaii, I am in love with the Hawaiian culture.
                    Luaus are one of the best examples of such diverse and beautiful culture. 
                    While most see it as just a tourist show, it actaully has a deep and profound history dating back thousands of years. 
                    It's one of the ways of storytelling and is a sophisticated artform. Everyone should experience it at least once in their life!

                <p class="details"> Cars | Old School | Big Body</p>
                <p class="description">
                    There's nothing like a heavy door, box frame, wide body, old school car and the Coup Deville is the crown jewel of that genre of Cars
                    It's sleek interior and classy exterior has made it one of the best in it's class.

                <h2>Phuket, Thailand</h2>
                <p class="details">Thailand | Phuket | Travel</p>
                <p class="description">
                    I had a wonderful experience in Thailand! To all of the travel heads out there, I highly recommend it. 
                    The food was cheap, the scenery was beautiful, and the people are so hospitable and nice. Whether you choose the bustling nightlife of Bangkok, or the amazing scenery of Phuket, it's a destination that won't miss.

                <img src="cajun pasta.jpg" alt="Cajun Pasta" />
                <h2>Cajun Pasta</h2>
                <p class="details">Food | Pasta | Cajun</p>
                <p class="description">
                    Now I love any dish with heavy cream and my protein of choice. But Cajun Pasta really takes the cake!
                    A fusion dish at it's core, it has the perfect blend of Italian, French, and Lousiana all on one plate.
                    If you love the creaminess of a chicken alfredo and the spiceness of Lousiana seasoning...you won't regret trying this dish.
